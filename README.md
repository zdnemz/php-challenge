# PHP Challenges

Welcome to my PHP Algorithm Practice repository! Here, you'll find a collection of PHP programs that I've created while honing my algorithmic and programming skills. 

These programs are the result of my practice sessions, often inspired by challenges from platforms like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## Directory Structure

- **src:** This directory contains the PHP programs I've developed to tackle various algorithmic challenges and practice problem-solving skills. Each file represents a specific problem or algorithm implementation.

## Getting Started

To explore the programs in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zdnemz/php-challenge
```

Navigate to the `src` directory to view and study the PHP programs. You can run these programs locally on your machine to see them in action or modify them to suit your learning needs.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding your own PHP solutions to algorithmic challenges or improving existing ones, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Contributions in the form of new challenges or enhancements to the README.md are also welcome!
